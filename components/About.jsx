				I am a creative and self-motivated web developer and UI designer who
				loves to solve problems. My background in math informs my logical
				approach, which I use to create simple solutions that are both
				useful and easy to understand. I have a vivid imagination which is
				fueled by my passion for reading, writing and gaming. Iâ€™m happy to
				learn new things whenever I get the chance, so feel free to contact
				me if youd like to talk more about any of my hobbies!
